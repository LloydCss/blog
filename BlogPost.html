        Hey guys, my name is Lloyd and I have majored in Multimedia Programming and Design and have done projects from Web Design to Coding HTML and Java and even some basic Template Designs. My main goal is to become a full time streamer and or professional gamer but at the same time graphic design and web design are things i find fun and interesting to do. Something about coding and design makes me want to do it more. The fact that i can make something out of nothing is satisfying, like turning a blank page into a website within a few minutes.

Recently i watched a documentary about an event called the fyre festival. The person who made it(Billy McFarland) wasn't the easiest person to talk to if you were working for him on the fyre music festival. One of the many things i can relate to, from the documentary is billy’s motivation to make something work. Now i don't agree with what he did at all, what he did was messed up,but his motivation to make his project work was great, he didn't want to give up at all, no matter what. He wanted to make it work so bad knowing all of the bad things set up to stop him. I can relate to him because i have motivation to be a successful professional gamer and or streamer no matter what i have to sacrifice or do, i won't go as far as billy though.

    One other thing i could relate to is billy’s go to friends for support. Whenever things got tough for billy, he always got his friend to do it for him or help him out. I have a few friends i can go to to help me out with something or do it for me completely . No matter how smart or great you are in the end you can't do it by yourself, you will need help from someone you trust and believe in to do exactly what you want without question or fighting you back. Billy wanted only positive thoughts and he knew if he took his friends with him, they wouldn't dare bring negative thoughts only positive thoughts to come help Billy.

There is a film in which i can also relate to when it comes to telling my own story on how i like Graphic design but i mainly have another goal of doing something else as my main plan in life. The film is called Rashomon, it's a very old film made in japan. In the beginning of the film two men were talking while seeming very disappointed in themselves or either the actual world they live in, then another man walks in the shrine in the middle of the conversation, he was drying off from the rain and seemed to see the two men were troubled , but it didn't seem to affect him, it just made him more interested in hearing the “farmer’s” story That made me not even assume that the farmer was ever a bad guy, because it was like a “I was just walking and this happened” kind of moment. I think this is where plot twist was first used because it is used alot in this film. When i tell people that i want to do graphic design or web design they seemed interested but then i tell them i want to be a streamer and they suddenly look like i just said something surprising because believe it or not a lot of the older generation doesn't believe sitting down and playing gamers can help you in life.
